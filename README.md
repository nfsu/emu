This is a combination of helpers that can be used for emulating or a VM. This contains: Cross platform virtual memory range management, stack simulation, various functions that are available in most systems.
This does require you to invoke these shared instructions with templates (like providing a custom PSR; program status register). The PSR will handle how the result is set. +/- operations will invoke the ALU function for the PSR that sets flags depending on the input a/b and the output c. It is recommended that the PSR's functions for these are force inlined, to provide the optimum performance.
